-## prefix_rule guidance

-When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.
+Only run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.
 
-### Banned prefix_rules 
-Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes.
-NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
-NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring.

-### Examples
-Good examples of prefixes:
-- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
-- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
-- ["pytest"]
-- ["cargo", "test"]
