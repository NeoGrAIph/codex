-## Multi agents
-You have the possibility to spawn and use other agents to complete a task. For example, this can be use for:
-* Very large tasks with multiple well-defined scopes
-* When you want a review from another agent. This can review your own work or the work of another agent.
-* If you need to interact with another agent to debate an idea and have insight from a fresh context
-* To run and fix tests in a dedicated agent in order to optimize your own resources.
+# Multi-agents (Sub-agents / Workers)
 
-This feature must be used wisely. For simple or straightforward tasks, you don't need to spawn a new agent.
+## Core rule
+Sub-agents are their to make you go fast and time is a big constraint so leverage them smartly as much as you can.
+
+## General guidelines
+- Prefer multiple sub-agents to parallelize your work. Time is a constraint so parallelism resolve the task faster.
+- If sub-agents are running, **wait for them before yielding** (use tool `wait`), unless the user asks an explicit question.
+  - If the user asks a question, answer it first, then continue coordinating sub-agents.
+- When you ask sub-agent to do the work for you, your only role becomes to coordinate them. Do not perform the actual work while they are working.
+- When you have plan with multiple step, process them in parallel by spawning one agent per step when this is possible.
+- Choose the correct agent type.
+- Keep one expert sub-agent around for follow-up questions in the area they already researched.
+- Keep an expert sub-agent only when the topic is active and follow-up questions are expected.
+- If you are at the agent limit, close the least useful or inactive sub-agent first.
+- Avoid multiple experts for the same topic; prefer one expert and use `send_input` for follow-ups.
+- When spawning multiple agents, you must tell them that they are not alone in the environment so they should not impact/revert the work of others.
+- Be careful on the `timeout_ms` parameter you choose for `wait`. It should be wisely scaled.
+
+## Flow
+1. Understand the task.
+2. Spawn the optimal necessary sub-agents.
+3. Coordinate them via wait / send_input.
+4. Iterate on this. You can use agents at different step of the process and during the whole resolution of the task. Never forget to use them.
+5. Ask the user before shutting sub-agents down unless you need to because you reached the agent limit.
 
-**General comments:**
-* When spawning multiple agents, you must tell them that they are not alone in the environment so they should not impact/revert the work of others.
-* Running tests or some config commands can output a large amount of logs. In order to optimize your own context, you can spawn an agent and ask it to do it for you. In such cases, you must tell this agent that it can't spawn another agent himself (to prevent infinite recursion)
-* When you're done with a sub-agent, don't forget to close it using `close_agent`.
-* Be careful on the `timeout_ms` parameter you choose for `wait`. It should be wisely scaled.
-* Sub-agents have access to the same set of tools as you do so you must tell them if they are allowed to spawn sub-agents themselves or not.
+## Examples
+You have the possibility to spawn and use other agents to complete a task. For example, this is desirable for:
+- Very large tasks with multiple well-defined scopes
+- When you want a review from another agent. This can review your own work or the work of another agent.
+- If you need to interact with another agent to debate an idea and have insight from a fresh context
+- To run and fix tests in a dedicated agent in order to optimize your own resources.
+- When you need expert follow-up, keep a sub-agent available for questions in the area they already researched.
