+## Agents registry (YAML)
+
+When the `fn_multi_agents` feature flag is enabled, Codex can discover agent definitions from `agents/` folders alongside each config layer:
+
+- Project: `.codex/agents` (next to `.codex/config.toml`)
+- User: `~/.codex/agents`
+- System: the folder containing the system config file
+
+Each agent file is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter and an instructions body:
+
+```md
+---
+name: "code-architect"
+description: "Architecture guidance and review."
+model: "gpt-5.2-codex"
+reasoning_effort: "medium"
+color: "cyan"
+tools: ["read_file", "apply_patch"]
+---
+
+You are a senior architect...
+```
+
+`model` must be a valid model slug (no alias mapping is applied). `reasoning_effort` is optional and should be one of: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.
+
+`tools` can be a list or a comma-separated string. If present, it acts as an allowlist
+that is intersected with any existing tool allowlist (it never expands beyond the
+current allowlist), and denylist rules still apply. Agent `tool_denylist` entries
+are merged with any existing denylist rather than replacing it. Use `*` to leave tool access
+unchanged.
+
+### Agent name variants
+
+You can declare `agent_names` to provide named instruction variants (A/B) and optionally
+override model and reasoning effort per variant:
+
+```md
+---
+name: "code-reviewer"
+description: "Review code with optional strictness."
+model: "gpt-5.2-codex"
+reasoning_effort: "medium"
+color: "cyan"
+agent_names:
+  - name: strict
+    description: "Strict review mode."
+    model: "gpt-4.1"
+    reasoning_effort: "high"
+  - name: lenient
+    description: "Faster, higher-level review."
+---
+
+Default reviewer instructions...
+
+<!-- agent_name: strict -->
+Strict instructions...
+
+<!-- agent_name: lenient -->
+Lenient instructions...
+```
+
+If `model` or `reasoning_effort` are specified under an `agent_name`, they take priority over
+the top-level values for that variant. Omitted fields inherit from the top-level values.
+
 ## JSON Schema
 
 The generated JSON Schema for `config.toml` lives at `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`.
