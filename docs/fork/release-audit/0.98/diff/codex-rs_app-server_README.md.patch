 - `thread/archive` — move a thread’s rollout file into the archived directory; returns `{}` on success.
 - `thread/name/set` — set or update a thread’s user-facing name; returns `{}` on success. Thread names are not required to be unique; name lookups resolve to the most recently updated thread.
 - `thread/unarchive` — move an archived rollout file back into the sessions directory; returns the restored `thread` on success.
-- `thread/compact/start` — trigger conversation history compaction for a thread; returns `{}` immediately while progress streams through standard turn/item notifications.
 - `thread/rollback` — drop the last N turns from the agent’s in-memory context and persist a rollback marker in the rollout so future resumes see the pruned history; returns the updated `thread` (with `turns` populated) on success.
 - `turn/start` — add user input to a thread and begin Codex generation; responds with the initial `turn` object and streams `turn/started`, `item/*`, and `turn/completed` notifications.
 - `turn/interrupt` — request cancellation of an in-flight turn by `(thread_id, turn_id)`; success is an empty `{}` response and the turn finishes with `status: "interrupted"`.
 - `review/start` — kick off Codex’s automated reviewer for a thread; responds like `turn/start` and emits `item/started`/`item/completed` notifications with `enteredReviewMode` and `exitedReviewMode` items, plus a final assistant `agentMessage` containing the review.
 - `command/exec` — run a single command under the server sandbox without starting a thread/turn (handy for utilities and validation).

 - `skills/list` — list skills for one or more `cwd` values (optional `forceReload`).
-- `skills/remote/read` — list public remote skills (**under development; do not call from production clients yet**).
-- `skills/remote/write` — download a public remote skill by `hazelnutId`; `isPreload=true` writes to `.codex/vendor_imports/skills` under `codex_home` (**under development; do not call from production clients yet**).
 - `app/list` — list available apps.
 - `skills/config/write` — write user-level skill config by path.

-### Example: Trigger thread compaction
-
-Use `thread/compact/start` to trigger manual history compaction for a thread. The request returns immediately with `{}`.
-
-Progress is emitted as standard `turn/*` and `item/*` notifications on the same `threadId`. Clients should expect a single compaction item:
-
-- `item/started` with `item: { "type": "contextCompaction", ... }`
-- `item/completed` with the same `contextCompaction` item id
-
-While compaction is running, the thread is effectively in a turn so clients should surface progress UI based on the notifications.

 ### Example: Start a turn (send user input)
 
 Turns attach user input (text or images) to a thread and trigger Codex generation. The `input` field is a list of discriminated unions:
